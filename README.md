## Install

After installing python and pip, install the below modules in the terminal:
```shell
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas    
```

Change your directory to the directory the python script is in and run ``main.py``: 
```shell
cd python-convert_html_table_to_csv
python3 main.py
```

- The .csv file will output in the same folder as your script. You can modify the output .csv file name or location by updating the ``output_path`` variable in ``main.py``.
- Be sure sure to modify ``main.py`` by changing the ``path`` variable to the website URL or web page you're trying to parse the HTML from.
